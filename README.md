xmonad configuration
====================

This repository contains the `xmonad.hs`, `.xmobarrc`, and `.xsession`
files that I use on Fedora (currently tested on Fedora 17).  This
configuration is based off of [Edward
Yang's](http://ezyang.com/haskell.html), with some modifications.

Installation
============

Install xmonad, xmobar, stalonetray, and GNOME using yum, and then
symlink or copy the files in this repository to the appropriate
locations in your home directory. xmobarrc and xsession need leading
dots, and xmonad.hs goes into the `.xmonad` folder.
